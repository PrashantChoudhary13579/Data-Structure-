# Data-Structure-
I have made several folder as per the labs held in a week . 
In those folder, I have written the code of the work done in each lab in each week.
A newbie can start learning the basics of data structure right from this repo.
the best material to learn the c++ is to basic documents from the https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp
“C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off.”
