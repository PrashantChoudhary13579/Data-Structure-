Aim = Make an array b from the given array a of the same size from 1 to n such that b[i] contains the product of elements of a[i] but not the element present at that index.
Algorithm = 
1. First take the array as a[10] of having the elements and an array b[10] not containing any values.
2. Now take a number as c=a[0] (containing the first element of the array) and start the loop from 1 to n and multiple all the elements of array a[i] and save it in the c.
3. Now again start the loop from 0 to n. now divide the value c by the elements present at that index and save it in the b[i].
Output =  Now print the elements of the array b.
