Aim = find the a raise to power n but the iteration should be less than n
Approach = 
1. We will take the input of base and it's power
2. We will store them and start the counting from 0 to find out the number of iteration it will go.
3. There will be two condition if power is equal to 0. Then c=1;
4. Otherwise it will be passed in else in which the loop will go on upto power is not equal to 0 .
5. In which we will multiply the base to the c and store it in c .
6. Now in the loop we will do decrement of the power and increment of the count.
Output = We will print the value of c and the number of iteration it is going on.

Time Complexity : O (n)

Space Complexity : O (1)
