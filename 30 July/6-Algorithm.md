Aim = We are given that a ball is falling on the ground with velocity v and at each bounce its velocity decreases by half. Then find the number of bounces 

Algorithm =

1. First take the velocity as user input
2. Let the count be 0. And start the while until velocity is not 0. 
3. In the loop increment the count as it measure the number of bounces and half the velocity .

Output = The number of bounces which is equal to count.
