Aim= List of n given numbers in which we have to print 3 numbers such that a+b=c
Algorithm =  
1. First we have to take the input of n numbers in an array .
2. Then we will start the first loop from i= 1 to n .To select the first element of the array.
3. Now we will start the second loop from j= i+1 to n .To select the second element of the array.
4. Now we have to start the third loop from k = 1 to n .To check that whether the sum of the first and second element is equal to element of the array.
5. Now print the elements which allow the condition.
Output = 
Elements of which follow the condition.

Time Complexity - O(n^3)
Space Complexity - O(n)
